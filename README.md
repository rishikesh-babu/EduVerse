## 🚨 Problem

- 250M+ children globally lack access to quality teachers, especially in rural and underserved regions.  
- Existing AI tutors are:
  - ❌ Internet-heavy  
  - ❌ English-centric  
  - ❌ Not inclusive of children with disabilities  
- Power cuts, patchy internet, and language barriers leave millions without reliable learning support.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**EduVerse AI** is built to bridge these gaps with:  
- **Offline-first resilience** → learning continues without stable internet.  
- **Accessibility-first design** → sign-language avatar, captions, and emotion-aware tutoring.  
- **Personalization** → career guidance, bite-sized modules, and adaptive feedback.  
- **Scalability** → works in low-resource settings across the Global South.
